# HomePy

> A small domotic system, based off a Raspberry Pi and made with Python

## Features

The point of the system is to be able to automate _everything_. This system should be able to make your life smoother by adding a new level of automation and frictionless interaction with tech in your life.

All of the features should be controllable via a web interface, because you should not need to get off your chain to turn on or off a feature.

Mainly, the planned features are :

* A way to control the lighting in my room
    * Double-tap in hand to turn on or turn off the lights of my room.
    * Alarm clock and gradual lighting up of my LEDs in the morning.
* NFC and/or code based door lock mechanism, maybe based off SSWOD.
*
